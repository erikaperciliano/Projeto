      <h1>About me</h1>

      <p>I live in São Paulo but I serve clients from all over the world. I am known for making quality products, durability and
         which add value to my clients..</p>
      <p>I work using a web as a platform, I breathe HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript (or rather: ECMASCript). Cryo
         sites for all, following as main guidelines of accessibility, responsiveness and semantic web, without
         to neglect code quality..</p>

      <h2>How work</h2>

      <blockquote class="fiat">
         <p>is the best front-end developer I have ever worked with. Very efficient and very capable. I recommend without a doubt!</p>   
         <cite>José Souza, Fiat </cite>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Satisfying my clients is priority. For this, a highly interactive development process,
         Based on continuous feedback. Do not work with closed scope: the customer decides when the product is
         ready.</p>

      <p>I also don´t work with deadlines: quality is too important to be sacrificed.</p>

      <h2>Experience</h2>

      <blockquote class="petrobras">
         <p>João dominates technologies like nobody else. I had a problem, he had the tip of his tongue the most appropriate solution with the latest technologies.</p>
         <cite>Manoel Santos, Petrobrás</cite>
      </blockquote>


      <p>I have already developed projects for big companies like <a href="http://www.bmw.com">BMW</a>, <a href="http://www.uol.com.br">UOL</a>and <a href="http://www.ibm.com.br">IBM</a>. In them, the main focus was to deliver a
         experience immersive and impactful to the end user without neglecting the performance and accessibility of the page.
      </p>
      <p>They have also been contracted for the transmission of large portals, such as Terra and G1, in responsive pages.
         Went Responsible for renewing the layout, reorganizing the content and rewriting the code in a more reusable way.</p>

      <h2>Community</h2>

      <p>I try to pass on my knowledge to the community. For this, I have given several lectures and I maintain a <a href="blog.html">blog</a>.
